## Audience Level 
Beginner. No previous knowledge is required.

## Audience
Anyone with an interest in research, communication, or advocacy is welcome. This course is especially useful for those looking to become more involved in advancing research policy and practice in their organization, institution, or discipline.

## Course Description 
Advancing better research policies and practices in our communities requires effective communication and strategic advocacy. This train-the-trainer course is an interactive and practical workshop to build skills in communication and advocacy with a focus on research transparency issues. 

Over two sessions, the course will arm participants with the practice, resources, and community of support they need to improve their skills and to train their peers in the same areas. In the first session, we will share tools, tricks, examples, and frameworks. We will also practice profiling, mapping, and targeting content to audiences. In the second session, we will create and critique personalized plans for communicating, advocating, and evaluating success that will help you advance transparency in your community.
